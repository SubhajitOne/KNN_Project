# KNN_Project
A Dataset is taken and classification was done using KNN classifier.
Here 'Target Class' is the labelled column.
A pairplot has been done on the whole dataset to see the corelations between the different features.
The model was then evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.
Elbow method was later used to find the best K value.
Then the model was again created using the new K value and the necessary evaluation was done with improved results.
